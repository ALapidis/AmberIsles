Alasia: The Amber Isles

High Concept:
A 3rd Person isometric perspective (Diablo) RPG with tactical action combat (DarkSouls/God of War) and open world exploration (Skyrim/Witcher 3) and side quests.

Controles: 
Virtual Joystick (left), Attack/Interact (right), Evade (right), Block (right), Skills/Items (right).

Notes:
3 Combat Modes (Melee, Ranged, Magic) with three unique combat systems.

- Melee: Timing based comboâ€™s with the action button: 3 quick light, light/medium/heavy, and charged attack. Strong block, weak evade.

- Ranged: Twin-stick controls for movement while shooting. Quiver = ammo clip and reload time. Shooting while standing skill creates a diminishing cone to represent aim for a charged power shot. Longer evade distance, weaker block.

- Magical: Twin-stick controls for movement while casting. Weapons have a charge percentage that diminished with each blast, and replenishes when not attacking. Holding button without pointing in a direction charges up a power blast. Poor evade, Strong reflective magical block.
