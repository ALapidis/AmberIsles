#Alasia: The Amber Isles

##High Concept:
A 3rd Person isometric perspective (*Diablo*) RPG with tactical action combat (*DarkSouls/God of War*) and open world exploration (*Skyrim/Witcher 3*) and side quests.

##Controles: 
1. Virtual Joystick (*left*)
2. Attack/Interact (*right*)
3. Evade (*right*)
4. Block (*right*)
5. Skills/Items (*right*).

##Notes:
There are 3 Combat Modes (Melee, Ranged, Magic) with three unique combat systems.

1. **Melee:** Timing based comboâ€™s with the action button: 3 quick light, light/medium/heavy, and charged attack. Strong block, weak evade.

2. **Ranged:** Twin-stick controls for movement while shooting. Quiver = ammo clip and reload time. Shooting while standing skill creates a diminishing cone to represent aim for a charged power shot. Longer evade distance, weaker block.

3. **Magical:** Twin-stick controls for movement while casting. Weapons have a charge percentage that diminished with each blast, and replenishes when not attacking. Holding button without pointing in a direction charges up a power blast. Poor evade, Strong reflective magical block.
