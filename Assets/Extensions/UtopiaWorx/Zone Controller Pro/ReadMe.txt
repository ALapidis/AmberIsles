Thank You for purchasing Zone Controller

In this package you will find a Demo Scene, which demonstrated the basics of how Zone Controller works. You will need to import the Standard Assets/Characters package to make full use of the demo.

The full documentation for Zone Controller is available in the Required/Documentation folder

If you are happy with Zone Controller Free and would like to help support the further development, please consider purchasing the full version of Zone Controller Pro which has many more features.

Also, I want to thank my good friends at Funfant for providing the demo audio clip used in many of our YouTube videos as well as the demo scene in this package.
